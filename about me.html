        later on transffered to Kongoni Primary in South C and I studied there upto class seven 
        and later on i went to Ayany Primary School where i sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary
        Education.Afterwards i went to Eluuya Girls High School in Western and decided to partake Computer Studies
        as a subject while in form.Later on,i was to choose between Computer studies and business studies.
        I thought thoroughly and decided to do Computer studies.Not only did i just take Computer because 
        I was good in it but also I had passion about computers and anything related to tachnology.I completed
        high school in 2016.</p>

     <h3>Why I took Programming as a course</h3>
     <p>Ever since i started doing computer in high school,i realized my undying passion in technology.At first it seemed 
         normal because as a student you just have to like a subject in order to do well in it but as time went by,my understanding
         for computers became great and intense.After finishing high school,i wanted to enroll in an computer related course but i did 
         not have the funds to do that.Thankfully,Moringa School came to my aid.Currently,I am pursuing Programming as a course and I 
         believe it will take me to greater heights as long as I excel in my studies.Programming has many opportunities regarding to being 
         employed by those large and successful companies.
