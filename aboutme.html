 <h3>Why I decided to take a class on <strong>programming;</strong></h3>
 <p>Ever since in high school I decided to choose Computer studies as a subject since it was an optional subject.As time went by 
     I realized my undying passion about technology in general.In form three there was a topic about programming though it was not 
     that widely explained but I had alot of interest in knowing more about programming.After my comlpletion in high school,i wanted
     to go to a school that offers programming course but I did not have the funds to do that.Later on,Shofco reffered me to Moringa
     school and thankfully I got a chance to study there.Programming has alot of benefits,you can get a really nice job after comlpletion
     of the course and the pay is quite encouraging and then you get to gain more skills in relation to the field.
